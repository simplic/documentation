# Reading the API Documentation

The API Documentation is split into two seperate Groups.
The **API - Core** page consists of the entire API for the Simplic Framework.
The **API - Plugins** page cosists of the API for all the plugins and SDKs.

You will find the Python API Documentation under the specific Module.
If you would like to check out the code, or find out which repository the concrete API is from, simply click _View Source_ on the top right of the page.
