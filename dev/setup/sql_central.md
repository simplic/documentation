# Installing Plug-ins for SQL Central

In order to connect to a database not supported by the plug-ins already installed for SQL central, it is necessary to install a new plug-in for the corresponding database type.
To achieve this, open directory `\\srvnas03\support\sybase\SQLAnywhere17` and execute the installation application to install the plug-in named after the database type it provides support for.
For example `SA17011_Windows_7254_EBF.exe` will provide support for SQL Anywhere version 17.0.11.
