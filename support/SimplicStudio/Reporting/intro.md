# Reporting

Simplic supports two types of reporting:

1. Telerik reports
2. EPL (Label) reports

Telerik reports are separated into three different types of reports:

1. Sql-Reports (A given SQL-Statements will replace all SQL-Statements within the report)
2. Key-Value-Reports (A list of keys and values will be passed to the report sql statements)
3. Parameter-Reports (A list of parameter will be passed to the report (data source and report parameter))
