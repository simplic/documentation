# Icon name format

Simplic icons needs to be named in the following scheme: `<object>_<action>_<width>x<heihgt>.<extension>`.

> Sample: document\_add\_32x32.png

If width and height has the same value, the height must not be written:

> Sample document\_add\_32x.png

The `<action>` part is optional, if an icon isn't connect with an action, the can be ignored:

> Sample: document_16x.png

The action must be named as the action displayed as icon overlay: `personalaccount_add_32x.png`
